Do you dream of building software that can adapt, learn, and collaborate? Get ready to discover a paradigm shift that's empowering developers to create more robust, intelligent, and scalable applications than ever before.\n\n### Main Section 1: Enhanced Modularity and Maintainability\n*   **Breaking Down Complexity:** Multi-agent systems (MAS) naturally encourage decomposition. Each agent handles a specific task or domain, leading to smaller, more manageable code units.\n*   **Simplified Debugging and Updates:** When a problem arises, you can often isolate it to a specific agent, making troubleshooting significantly faster. Updates or modifications can also be applied to individual agents without affecting the entire system.\n*   **Increased Reusability:** Well-defined agents with clear responsibilities can be easily reused across different projects, saving development time and effort.\n\n### Main Section 2: Improved Scalability and Resilience\n*   **Distributed Power:** MAS can distribute workload across multiple agents, allowing applications to handle a much larger volume of tasks and data than a single-threaded application.\n*   **Fault Tolerance:** If one agent fails, others can often pick up its slack or continue operating, making the overall system more resilient to failures. This is crucial for applications requiring high availability.\n*   **Dynamic Adaptation:** Agents can be added or removed dynamically based on system load or changing requirements, allowing for flexible scaling up or down.\n\n### Main Section 3: Fostering Intelligence and Autonomy\n*   **Delegation and Specialization:** Developers can delegate complex decision-making or repetitive tasks to specialized agents, freeing up their time for higher-level problem-solving.\n*   **Emergent Behavior:** The interaction of multiple agents can lead to emergent, intelligent behaviors that were not explicitly programmed, allowing for more sophisticated and adaptive systems.\n*   **Simulating Real-World Scenarios:** MAS are excellent for modeling complex systems and simulating interactions, which is invaluable for research, optimization, and understanding intricate processes.\n\n### Main Section 4: Accelerating Development Cycles\n*   **Parallel Development:** Different teams or developers can work on individual agents concurrently, significantly speeding up the overall development process.\n*   **Abstraction and Focus:** Developers can focus on designing agent interactions and behaviors, abstracting away lower-level implementation details handled by other agents.\n*   **Leveraging Existing Agent Libraries:** The growing ecosystem of agent frameworks and libraries allows developers to quickly integrate pre-built agent functionalities, reducing boilerplate code.\n\n### Concluding Thought:\n*   Embracing multi-agent systems isn't just about adopting a new technology; it's about shifting your mindset towards building more intelligent, adaptable, and robust software. By understanding and leveraging the power of these interconnected agents, you can elevate your development capabilities and create the next generation of sophisticated applications.\nWriterAgent > ## Unlock Superpowers: How Multi-Agent Systems Will Revolutionize Your Development Workflow\n\nAre you tired of monolithic codebases that are a nightmare to maintain?

You've seen how parallel agents can dramatically speed up workflows by running independent tasks concurrently.\n\nSo far, all our workflows run from start to finish and then stop. **But what if you need to review and improve an output multiple times?** Next, we'll build a workflow that can loop and refine its own work.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n## ➰ Section 5: Loop Workflows - The Refinement Cycle\n\n**The Problem: One-Shot Quality**\n\nAll the workflows we've seen so far run from start to finish. The `SequentialAgent` and `ParallelAgent` produce their final output and then stop. This 'one-shot' approach isn't good for tasks that require refinement and quality control. What if the first draft of our story is bad? We have no way to review it and ask for a rewrite.\n\n**The Solution: Iterative Refinement**\n\nWhen a task needs to be improved through cycles of feedback and revision, you can use a `LoopAgent`. A `LoopAgent` runs a set of sub-agents repeatedly *until a specific condition is met or a maximum number of iterations is reached.* This creates a refinement cycle, allowing the agent system to improve its own work over and over.\n\n**Use Loop when:** Iterative improvement is needed, quality refinement matters, or you need repeated cycles.\n\nTo learn more, check out the documentation related to [loop agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/loop-agents/).\n\n**Architecture: Story Writing & Critique Loop**\n\n<!--\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[\"Initial Prompt\"] -- > B[\"Writer Agent\"]\n    B -- >|story| C[\"Critic Agent\"]\n    C -- >|critique| D{\"Iteration < Max<br>AND<br>Not Approved?\"}\n    D -- >|Yes| B\n    D -- >|No| E[\"Final Story\"]\n\n    style B fill:#ccffcc\n    style C fill:#ffcccc\n    style D fill:#ffffcc\n```\n-->","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img width=\"250\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day1/loop-agent.png\" alt=\"Loop Agent\" />","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 5.1 Example: Iterative Story Refinement\n\nLet's build a system with two agents:\n\n1. **Writer Agent** - Writes a draft of a short story\n2. **Critic Agent** - Reviews and critiques the short story to suggest improvements","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent runs ONCE at the beginning to create the first draft.\ninitial_writer_agent = Agent(\n    name=\"InitialWriterAgent\",\n    model=Gemini(\n        model=\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\",\n        retry_options=retry_config\n    ),\n    instruction=\"\"\"Based on the user's prompt, write the first draft of a short story (around 100-150 words).\n    Output only the story text, with no introduction or explanation.\"\"\",\n    output_key=\"current_story\",  # Stores the first draft in the state.\n)\n\nprint(\"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\")","metadata":{"id":"a2b8WlJoBtHF","outputId":"13ed1e15-dcf9-4e1d-ad1e-fb18ee793de5","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-15T06:33:34.023305Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-15T06:33:34.023669Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-15T06:33:34.029342Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-15T06:33:34.023647Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-15T06:33:34.028336Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":23},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent's only job is to provide feedback or the approval signal.

Before he finds the map, consider adding a brief reflection on his loneliness, his routine, or a hint of a past that makes this discovery even more impactful. For example, does he yearn for adventure, or is he content in his solitude? This will make his \"long dormant\" curiosity feel more earned.\n\n2.  **Elaborate on the map's mystery:** The description of the map is intriguing, but could be expanded. What do the pulsing symbols *suggest*? Are they celestial, nautical, or something entirely alien? What does the \"jagged coastline\" resemble? Giving the reader a bit more to ponder about the map's potential origin or purpose will enhance the sense of wonder and mystery.\n\n3.  **Hint at the immediate next step:** The story ends with Elias pocketing the map and the sea feeling less predictable. This is a good hook, but consider a brief sentence or two that suggests Elias's immediate reaction or intention. Does he look out at the sea with a new determination? Does he feel a pang of fear mixed with excitement? This will provide a stronger sense of forward momentum.\nRefinerAgent > The salt spray kissed Elias's weathered face as he climbed the spiral stairs, the rhythmic sweep of the lamp above his constant companion. For thirty years, he’d kept this lonely vigil, the sea his only confidante. His days were a predictable tide of polishing brass, trimming wicks, and scanning the horizon—a life he'd chosen after a heartbreak he rarely revisited, a quiet existence a world away from the bustling cities he’d left behind. He often wondered if contentment was the same as resignation, if the vastness of the ocean mirrored the emptiness within him. Tonight, however, was different.
