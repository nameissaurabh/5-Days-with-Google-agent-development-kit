# 🧠 5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course with Google (Kaggle-Mentor3)

Welcome to the **5-Day AI Agents Intensive**, a hands-on online program crafted by **Google’s ML researchers and engineers** to help developers master the design, orchestration, and deployment of intelligent AI agents.

---

## 📚 Overview

Over 5 days, you’ll explore the **core components** of AI agents — models, tools, orchestration, memory, and evaluation — through **whitepapers, podcasts, codelabs, and live sessions**.  
By the end, you’ll be able to **build, evaluate, and deploy production-ready AI agents** using Google’s **Agent Development Kit (ADK)** and **Gemini** models.
