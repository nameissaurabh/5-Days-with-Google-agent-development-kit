Here are some of the key areas and recent advancements:\n\n**1. AI for Target Identification and Validation:**\n\n*   **Uncovering Novel Disease Targets:** AI can analyze vast amounts of biological data (genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, clinical data) to identify previously unknown genes, proteins, or pathways that play a crucial role in diseases. This opens up entirely new avenues for drug development.\n*   **Predicting Target Druggability:** AI models are being developed to predict whether a potential drug target is \"druggable\" – meaning if it's possible to design a molecule that can effectively interact with it to achieve a therapeutic effect.\n\n**2. Generative AI for Molecule Design:**\n\n*   **De Novo Drug Design:** This is perhaps the most talked-about area. Instead of screening existing libraries of compounds, generative AI models (like Variational Autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks) can *design entirely new molecules* with specific desired properties (e.g., binding affinity to a target, solubility, low toxicity).\n*   **Optimizing Existing Molecules:** AI can also take existing drug candidates and suggest modifications to improve their efficacy, reduce side effects, or enhance their pharmacokinetic properties.\n*   **Exploring Vast Chemical Space:** Generative AI allows researchers to explore an exponentially larger chemical space than traditional methods, increasing the chances of finding a breakthrough compound.\n\n**3.

This is crucial for personalized medicine.\n*   **Predicting Trial Outcomes:** AI is being used to analyze historical clinical trial data to predict the likelihood of success for ongoing trials, helping companies make better investment decisions.\n*   **Virtual Clinical Trials:** In some cases, AI is enabling \"in silico\" (computer-simulated) trials, which can complement or even reduce the need for some physical patient trials, especially in early stages.\n\n**4. Advancements in Specific Therapeutic Areas:**\n\n*   **Oncology:** AI is instrumental in identifying new cancer targets, designing personalized cancer therapies based on a tumor's genetic profile, and predicting patient response to chemotherapy and immunotherapy.\n*   **Neuroscience and Rare Diseases:** For diseases with complex biology or small patient populations, AI's ability to find patterns in limited data is proving invaluable for discovering new treatment approaches.\n*   **Infectious Diseases:** AI is being used to rapidly identify potential antiviral or antibacterial agents, especially in response to emerging pandemics.\n\n**Examples of recent progress and companies in this space (this is not exhaustive):**\n\n*   **Insilico Medicine:** Known for its AI-powered drug discovery platform, they have advanced AI-designed drugs into clinical trials for various conditions.\n*   **Exscientia:** This company uses AI to design novel drug molecules and optimize them, often collaborating with larger pharmaceutical companies.\n*   **Atomwise:** Uses deep learning for small molecule drug discovery, focusing on predicting binding interactions.\n*   **Recursion Pharmaceuticals:** Combines AI with experimental biology to map cellular biology and discover new drug candidates.\n*   **BenevolentAI:** Leverages AI to analyze vast scientific literature and data to identify novel drug targets and potential treatments.\n\n**Key trends driving these developments:**\n\n*   **Availability of Large Datasets:** The explosion of biological and chemical data (genomics, electronic health records, chemical libraries) provides the fuel for AI algorithms.\n*   **Advancements in Machine Learning Algorithms:** Sophisticated deep learning techniques are enabling more powerful predictive and generative capabilities.\n*   **Computational Power:** Increased access to high-performance computing allows for the training of complex AI models.\n*   **Collaborations:** Pharmaceutical giants are increasingly partnering with or acquiring AI-focused biotech companies.\n\nWhile challenges remain (like ensuring the reproducibility of AI-generated findings, regulatory hurdles, and the need for clinical validation), the impact of AI on drug discovery is undeniable and is poised to revolutionize how new medicines are developed in the years to come.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're likely referring to **Generative AI for Molecule Design** (my second point in the previous answer). This is indeed one of the most transformative aspects of AI in drug discovery right now.\n\nLet me elaborate on what this entails and why it's so significant:\n\n**What is Generative AI for Molecule Design?**\n\nTraditional drug discovery often involves screening vast libraries of existing chemical compounds to find one that interacts with a specific biological target (like a protein involved in a disease). This is a time-consuming and often inefficient process.\n\nGenerative AI flips this approach. Instead of searching for existing solutions, it **creates entirely new solutions from scratch**. In the context of drug discovery, this means designing novel molecular structures that possess desired therapeutic properties.\n\n**How does it work (in simplified terms)?**\n\n1.  **Training Data:** Generative AI models are trained on massive datasets of known molecules and their properties. This data can include information about:\n    *   Chemical structures\n    *   Known drug molecules\n    *   Their interactions with targets\n    *   Their observed biological activity (efficacy)\n    *   Their physical and chemical properties (solubility, stability)\n    *   Toxicity data\n\n2.  **Learning Patterns and Rules:** The AI learns the underlying \"rules\" of chemistry and biology that govern how molecules behave and interact. It understands how different atoms and bonds can be arranged to create specific effects.\n\n3.  **Generating Novel Molecules:** Once trained, the AI can be prompted to generate new molecular structures. Researchers can specify desired attributes, such as:\n    *   **Target Affinity:** The molecule should bind strongly to a particular protein.\n    *   **Pharmacokinetic Properties:** It should be easily absorbed by the body, distributed to the right tissues, metabolized at an appropriate rate, and excreted.\n    *   **Low Toxicity:** It should not cause harmful side effects.\n    *   **Synthesizability:** It should be a molecule that chemists can actually create in the lab.\n\n**Types of Generative AI Models Used:**\n\n*   **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** These models learn a compressed \"latent space\" representation of molecules and can then decode points from this space to generate new, diverse molecules.\n*   **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** These involve two neural networks – a \"generator\" that creates molecules and a \"discriminator\" that tries to distinguish between real and generated molecules. This adversarial process pushes the generator to create increasingly realistic and effective molecules.\n*   **Transformer Networks (similar to those used in language models):** These can be adapted to learn sequential patterns in molecular representations and generate new sequences (representing molecules).\n\n**Why is this a Game-Changer?**\n\n*   **Vastly Expanded Chemical Space:** The number of theoretically possible molecules is astronomically large. Generative AI allows us to explore this space much more effectively than ever before, increasing the chances of finding truly novel and potent drug candidates.\n*   **Accelerated Discovery Cycles:** By designing molecules with specific properties upfront, it can significantly reduce the time and resources spent on hit-to-lead optimization.\n*   **Designing for Specific Needs:** Instead of finding a needle in a haystack, AI can be instructed to *build* the needle for a specific lock. This is particularly powerful for targets that have been historically \"undruggable.\"\n*   **Personalized Medicine:** In the future, generative AI could potentially design molecules tailored to an individual patient's unique genetic makeup or disease profile.\n\n**Challenges and Nuances:**\n\n*   **Synthesizability:** A generated molecule might be theoretically perfect but impossible or extremely difficult for chemists to synthesize in the lab. Researchers are increasingly building \"synthesizability predictors\" into the generative process.\n*   **Experimental Validation:** AI-generated molecules still need to be synthesized and rigorously tested in laboratory experiments and clinical trials. AI is a powerful tool, but it doesn't replace the need for real-world validation.\n*   **Data Bias:** If the training data is biased, the AI may generate molecules that are only effective for certain populations or have unintended consequences.\n*   **Interpretability:** Understanding *why* an AI generated a particular molecule can sometimes be challenging, though efforts in explainable AI (XAI) are addressing this.\n\nIn essence, generative AI for molecule design represents a paradigm shift from \"searching\" for drugs to \"engineering\" them. It's a testament to how AI can augment human creativity and scientific understanding to tackle complex problems like developing life-saving medicines.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  The landscape of companies involved in generative AI for molecule design is dynamic and includes a mix of dedicated AI-biotech startups, established pharmaceutical giants investing heavily in AI, and academic research groups pushing the boundaries.\n\nHere are some of the main players and categories:\n\n**1.

The AI explained that this AI approach designs novel molecules from scratch, unlike traditional screening methods. It works by training on vast datasets of molecules and their properties, learning chemical and biological rules, and then generating new structures with specified desired attributes like target affinity and low toxicity.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
